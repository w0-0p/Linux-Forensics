The aims of this repo are:
1. Gathering all relevant TTPs threat actors can use in Linux and
   organize them according the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.
2. Documenting how Velociraptor could be used to hunt for these TTPs.
   The hunting techniques should be checked with the main Linux distros.
3. Improve Velociraptor to fill missing gaps, either in the code base
   or with additionnal artifacts.


To Do:
- test artifact Linux.Collection.CatScale
- create artifact for Shell Configuration files
